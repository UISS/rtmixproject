RTMixManagerâ„¢ version $currentver<br>
developed by LENAROX.<br>
<br>
this engine will solve any lags and crashes on games, heavy apps and so on.<br>
which most of the mid-range android gamers have always wanted;)<br>
rock your RAM Manager like a Windows NT!!!(da well known BOSS of RAM Management), you know what i mean.:p<br>
ATTENTION!!! this engine requires the latest busybox version FROM stericson, installed to run properly.<br>
reminder: this engine is designed to run in the background realtime(yeah, RT lol:p) with the android ram management,<br>
therefore it should NOT be used with other script applications.<br>
